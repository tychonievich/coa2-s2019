title: Computer Organization and Architecture 2
...

# Overview 

This is our first offering of a course we hope will, along with several other
courses, replace and update several of our current courses.
More information about the pilot of these courses as a whole may be found at
<http://pilot.cs.virginia.edu/>.

For the sake of conversing with those familiar with our other course offerings,
this course covers much of CS 3330 "Computer Architecture" but at a higher level of detail;
the concurrency and security topics from CS 4414 "Operating Systems";
in addition to having several new topics we felt were under-represented in our
previous set of course offerings.
