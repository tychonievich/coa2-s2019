title: Spring 2019 Schedule
...

The specific details of the course content have been identified
by a committee of experienced faculty,
and have been taught before in other classes,
but because this is the first time we've taught them in this order
we might be slightly off on how long each will take.
Do not be surprised if/when the schedule changes.
